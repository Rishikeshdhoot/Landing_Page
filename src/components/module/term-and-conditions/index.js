      <p>
        Fornax facilitates the connection between patients and healthcare
        service providers, and it’s important to note that Fornax does not

        facilitate the scheduling of appointments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any medical services received by patients are directly provided by
        independent healthcare service providers who are not affiliated with

        injuries, or adverse effects resulting from the medical services
        rendered by the healthcare service providers.

      <p>
        Patients are advised to exercise their own judgment, due diligence, and
        discretion when selecting and engaging with healthcare service
        providers. It is the responsibility of the healthcare service providers
        to ensure compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and professional
        standards, and patients should direct any concerns or issues directly to
        the healthcare service provider involved.
